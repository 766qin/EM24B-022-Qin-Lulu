# Welcome to my website!
Hello everyone, my name is Qin Lulu and I am delighted to introduce myself here.
Hi, Iâ€™m Qin Lulu, a education management student with a passion for innovation.  
I graduated from Qiqihar University with a degree in Biological Science Teacher Training.  
In my free time, I enjoy playing the violin and reading .  
I choose to complete my postgraduate study in Belarusian State University, where the teachers have a strong academic background and the students are united and loving.
I'm a team player and always eager to learn new skills.  
Excited to introduce myself to you .
